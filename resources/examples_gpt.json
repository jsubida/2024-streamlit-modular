After about a month of hard work, I was upset to see that I had actually gained a few pounds instead of losing them. This made me feel incredibly frustrated and hopeless, like all the effort I had put in was pointless. I began to doubt whether I could ever succeed in my weight loss journey. I was on the verge of giving up when I talked to a friend who reminded me that setbacks are a normal part of the process. They suggested that I focus on non-scale victories, like how my clothes were fitting better and I had more energy This conversation re-motivated me to keep going, and I decided to shift my focus from just the numbers on the scale to how I was feeling overall.",
